# Real-Time Emotion Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for a real-time emotion detection system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is capable of detecting emotions such as anger, fear, happiness, and sadness from facial images in real-time.

## Overview

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: The dataset contains around 60,000 facial images labeled with different emotions. Special methods were employed to collect more images for each emotion label, and manual folder organization was performed to ensure diversity in the dataset.

2. **Data Augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques were used to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the model's generalization ability.

3. **Model Architecture**: The CNN model architecture consists of three convolutional layers followed by three dense layers, designed to classify images into seven emotion classes.

4. **Model Training**: The model was trained on the preprocessed and augmented dataset to achieve over 83% accuracy.

5. **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: The trained model is capable of processing images in real-time and accurately detecting emotions.
6. **Real-time emotion detection and data saving: It also provides the possibility to show the result in realtime and also create a new file naming new training data and get the new images and preprocesses it and save it in the directory for future use.
